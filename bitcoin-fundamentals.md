# Bitcoin Fundamentals

Some of the fundamentals of bitcoin are listed below. Hopefully this
serves as a nice foundation to build on!

### Money Fundamentals

To understand why we need bitcoin, it’s important to understand money itself. Read [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JohnCantrell97/status/1486749106131324934?s=20&t=HyLZEntCZqxQYdA3HNF4dA) by John Cantrell for an excellent breakdown.

### Bitcoin Practical Fundamentals

1. Freedom to receive
2. Freedom to hold
3. Freedom to send

### Bitcoin Monetization Path

1. Store of value
2. Medium of exchange
3. Unit of account (hyperbitcoinization)

### Bitcoin Monetary Fundamentals

- Divisible: [1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis (sats)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit))
- Portable: Information that can be sent through a communications channel or stored in your head
- Fungible: [UTXO sets](https://river.com/learn/bitcoins-utxo-model/) allows bitcoin (or sats) to be sent in any amount. Multiple bills can be used to make up $20. Same concept.
- Durable: Incorruptible ledger [secured by miners and verified by nodes](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified#start)
- Scarce: Algorithmically enforced supply of 21,000,000 units ([technically slightly less](https://www.pierrerochard.com/auditing-bitcoin-supply/)) that can't be changed.

### Bitcoin Technical Fundamentals

- Decentralized: no single point of failure
- Terminal inflation = 0: Fixed supply of 21,000,000 bitcoin ([technically slightly less](https://www.pierrerochard.com/auditing-bitcoin-supply/))
- Predictable supply schedule: [block reward halves](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769) every 210,000 blocks
- Permissionless: anyone can use the protocol
- Peer-to-peer: no trusted third parties
- Proof of work: secures the network
- [Difficulty adjustment](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/difficulty): major innovation of Bitcoin that maintains the fixed supply schedule
- Fungible UTXO sets
- Censorless: nobody can stop a Bitcoin transaction
- Verifiable: run your own version of the software to verify the ledger for yourself (”Don't trust, Verify”)
- Uses [Public-private key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
- Trustless: no third party required to transfer information from 'A' to 'B'
- Reliable: 24/7/365
- Open source: anyone can see the code, contribute to the project, build tools and add layers on top of Bitcoin. Adaptable.
- Secure: secured by miners - the most secure computing network in the world
- Universal: anyone with an internet connection can use Bitcoin
